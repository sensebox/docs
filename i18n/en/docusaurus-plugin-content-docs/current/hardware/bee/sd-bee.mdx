# SD-Bee

With the microSD-Bee, the data of the senseBox can be stored on an SD card.

<ImageWithText src={sdBee} alt="SD Modul" title="SD Bee"/> 


# Technical Information
* "Plug-in-and-Go" senseBox compatible
* Port for miniSD card
* Designation: mSD-Bee
* Dimensions: 24mm x 21mm x 9mm
* Weight: 2.4 g

Make sure that the mSD-Bee is connected to the XBEE2 connector of the senseBox-MCU, otherwise there may be problems saving your measurement data.

## Programming (Arduino)
In the following example, we show you how the string `Hello World!` is saved on the SD card in a file named `senseBox.txt`. 

```cpp
// Include the libraries
#include <SPI.h>
#include <SD.h>

File myFile;
// Name of the file on the SD card
// Make sure that this name (without file extension) is not longer than 8 characters!
String fileName = "senseBox.txt";

void setup()
{ 
    // Starting the SD-Bee
    SD.begin(28);
    // Open the file on the SD card
    myFile = SD.open(fileName, FILE_WRITE);
    myFile.close();

    hdc.begin();
};

void loop()
{
    // Open file with write access
    myFile = SD.open(fileName, FILE_WRITE);
    myFile.println("Hallo Welt!");
    // After use, the file is closed again
    myFile.close();
};
```

## Programming (Blockly)

The `Create file on SD card` block can be used in the setup() to create a new file on the SD card. 
The name of the file can be changed in the dropdown menu of the block.

With the `Open file on SD card` block, the previously created file can be opened in the endless loop.

In the free block section of the `Open file on SD card` block, the `Write data to SD card` block can then be placed. 
In this, the text or number to be written can be placed in the free block section. 
In addition, by checking the box at `Line break`, it can be determined whether a line break should be inserted after each measured value or not.

Additionally, we get the block for an interval from the `Time` category and the desired sensor from the `Sensors` category.
