## Tiny computer but a lot of fun
With the senseBox:mini, coding becomes child's play. 
The entry into programming the senseBox is easy, children and adults can start immediately without prior knowledge and celebrate success in no time.
From blinking the built-in RGB LED, data storage on an SD card, to the IoT environmental monitoring station, everything is possible.

## The Internet of Things
In the Internet of Things (IoT), physical and virtual objects are interconnected. 
With the senseBox:mini, you can build and program your own IoT devices and gain insights into technologies (keyword Smart Cities, Smart Home) that will revolutionize our everyday lives.

## Easily expandable
The senseBox:mini is not limited to the hardware it contains. 
You can connect any senseBox sensor and program it using our graphical programming interface. 
The senseBox MCU is also fully Arduino compatible.
