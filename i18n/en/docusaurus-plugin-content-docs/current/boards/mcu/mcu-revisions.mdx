### V1.5 with USB-C port
Version 1.5 of the senseBox MCU is equipped with a USB-C port. This allows for easy and fast connection to the computer. Version 1.5 is compatible with all previous versions of the senseBox MCU.

Because of the scarcity of electronic components, a batch of revision 1.5 was delivered without an acceleration sensor (BMX055). 
If you are unsure whether your senseBox MCU has an acceleration sensor, the graphic below will help you. 
The upper version of the MCU V1.5 has an acceleration sensor, the lower version does not.
