## Supplying the senseBox with power
To use the senseBox, it must be supplied with power. There are two ways to supply the senseBox with power:

### 1. USB cable
You can supply the senseBox with power using a USB-C cable. This is the easiest option if you are programming on a computer.
Plug the smaller end of the USB cable into the USB port of the senseBox MCU. The USB port is located at the top next to the red reset button.
The other end of the cable is plugged into the USB port of your computer or a power bank.

### 2. Battery
If you want to supply your senseBox with power via a battery, you can do this via the two-pin JST connector on the senseBox MCU. 
Simply plug the JST connector of the battery into the JST connector on the senseBox MCU. This is located at the top, next to the USB connection.
