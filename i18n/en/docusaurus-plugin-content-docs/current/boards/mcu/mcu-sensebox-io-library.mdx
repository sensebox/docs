# senseBoxIO Library

The senseBoxIO library is part of the board support package and is installed automatically.

The senseBoxIO library can be included individually with the following command:

```cpp
include <senseBoxIO.h>
```

:::info

If you are already using the senseBoxMCU library, the senseBoxIO library is already integrated and does not need to be included separately.

## Turning Ports On/Off

With the senseBoxIO library, unused ports can be turned on/off:

#### Deactivating all Ports

```cpp
 void powerNone(void)
```

#### Activating all Ports

```cpp
  void powerAll(void)
```

#### Selective Turning On/Off of Ports and Connections

```cpp

  void powerI2C(bool on) //power the I2C Ports

  void powerUART(bool on) //power the UART Ports

  void powerXB1(bool on) //power XBEE Port 1

  void powerXB2(bool on) //power XBEE Port 2

  void SPIselectNone(void) //

  void SPIselectXB1(void) //

  void SPIselectXB2(void) //

```

## Turning Status LEDs On/Off

Allows turning the status LEDs on/off

```cpp
  void statusNone(void) // deactivate all status LEDs

  void statusRed(void) //activate the red status LED

  void statusGreen(void) //activate the green status LED
```
