# Installation of the Board Support Package

<div>
  <div class="description">
    To ensure the Arduino IDE supports your senseBox MCU and you can upload programs to it, you need to install two Board Support Packages beforehand. 
    These include the necessary drivers and software to communicate with the senseBox processor. 
    The senseBox Board Support Package also includes our senseBox libraries, providing you with all the basic methods for programming the included sensors.
