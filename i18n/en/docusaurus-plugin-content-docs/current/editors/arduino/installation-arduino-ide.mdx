    Linux users can use the `AppImage` provided by Arduino to install Arduino. After downloading, the AppImage needs to be given execution permissions,
  </p>
  <code>cd Downloads</code> <br />
  <code>chmod +x arduino-ide_2.2.1_Linux_64bit.AppImage</code> <br />
  <code>./arduino-ide_2.2.1_Linux_64bit.AppImage</code>
  <p>
    Alternatively, the AppImage can also be made executable via the Graphic User Interface.
    Instructions on how to do this can be found {" "}
    <a href="https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/quickstart.html">here</a>{" "}.
