# Web - openSenseMap

## openSenseMap

The [openSenseMap](https://www.opensensemap.org) is an open data portal for environmental data. To send measurements to it, you first need to create a new senseBox. Then, you will be shown a Box ID and Sensor IDs for each specified sensor. More information can be found in the openSenseMap section.

To send measurements to openSenseMap, you must first connect your box to it. Use the `Connect to openSenseMap` block.

In the first dropdown menu of the block, you can select whether your senseBox should send data to the traditional openSenseMap or to workshop.openSenseMap.

> **opensensemap.org:** senseBoxes created for long-term measurements.
>
> **workshop.opensensemap.org:** senseBoxes created for short-term experiments or testing.

In the second dropdown menu of the block, you select whether your senseBox is a stationary or a mobile station, and in the text field "senseBox ID," you enter the senseBox ID displayed after registration.
In the free block section `Sensors`, the connected sensors must then be linked using the `Send measurement to openSenseMap` block.

In this block, the "Sensor ID" displayed after registration is added and linked to the corresponding sensor in the free block section.
:::warning Caution
Sensor IDs are specific to each sensor. It is important to ensure that the correct ID is assigned to the correct sensor/measurement.
