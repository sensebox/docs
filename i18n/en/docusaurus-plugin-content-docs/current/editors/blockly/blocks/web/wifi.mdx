## General

In Blockly, you have various options for implementing projects that work with the internet. For all of them, you must first connect your senseBox to the internet.

## WiFi

With the `Connect to WiFi` block, you can connect your senseBox to a WiFi network in the Setup(). Enter the network name under SSID and the WiFi password under Password.

With the `Initialize WiFi Access Point` block, your senseBox can create a WiFi network that you can join with other devices. In the SSID text field, you can set the name of your network.
