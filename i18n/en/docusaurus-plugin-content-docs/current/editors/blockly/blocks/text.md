The regular Create-Text-From block can be expanded by clicking the gear icon. You can add more elements by clicking and dragging to create text from multiple components. After editing, you can close the window by clicking the gear icon again.

> For example, the text block "senseBox" would be 8 units long.

## is empty

With the `is empty` block, you can check if a given text block is empty (has a length of 0). The result is either true (if the given text block is indeed empty) or false (if there are characters in the text block).
