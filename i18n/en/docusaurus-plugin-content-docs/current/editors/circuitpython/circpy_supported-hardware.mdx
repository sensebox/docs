# Limited Support
Not all sensors and modules of the senseBox can currently be used with CircuitPython.  
For many, libraries already exist, while for others support is still missing. New libraries are gradually being developed by the community or directly for the senseBox.  
You can find an overview of the supported hardware and sensors in the table below.

To use the libraries, you can download the release from the right-hand side of the GitHub repositories.  
Make sure to download the file named **"10.x-mpy_.zip"**.  
Then unzip the file and copy the included _.mpy_ files into the `lib` folder on the CIRCUITPY drive.
