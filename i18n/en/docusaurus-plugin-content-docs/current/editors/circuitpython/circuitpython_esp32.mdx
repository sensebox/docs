# Installing CircuitPython
CircuitPython is a variant of MicroPython developed by Adafruit. It is a simplified version of Python, specifically for microcontrollers. CircuitPython is a great way to quickly and easily get started with programming microcontrollers. In this tutorial, we will show you how to install CircuitPython on your senseBox MCU-S2.

## Installing CircuitPython
To install CircuitPython on your senseBox MCU-S2, follow these steps:
1. Visit the [CircuitPython Download Page](https://circuitpython.org/board/sensebox_mcu_esp32s2/).
2. Connect your senseBox MCU-S2 to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Hold down the Boot button on the senseBox MCU-S2 and then press the Reset button. Release the Boot button.
4. Click on the `OPEN INSTALLER` button and select `Full CircuitPython X.X.X Install` (X.X.X represents the latest CircuitPython version).
5. Click `Next` and connect to your senseBox MCU-S2 in the next menu. Click the `Connect` button and select `ESP32-S2` as the device.
7. Click `Continue` and wait for the flash to be erased and the combined.bin file to be flashed. This process may take a few minutes.
8. Press the Reset button on the senseBox MCU-S2 to start the bootloader. A new drive named `senseBox` will appear.
9. Click `Select Bootloader Drive` and choose the `senseBox` drive.
9. CircuitPython will now be loaded onto the MCU. After a few seconds, you should see a new drive named `CIRCUITPY`.
10. CircuitPython has been successfully installed. The Web-Installer does not indicate that the process is complete, so you can simply close the Web-Installer.
11. You can now use CircuitPython on your senseBox MCU-S2.


## Hello World Programm
To verify that CircuitPython has been successfully installed, we will show you a simple Hello World program.
1. Visit the [CircuitPython Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/).
2. Connect your senseBox MCU-S2 to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Connect to your senseBox MCU-S2 via `USB`.
4. Click on `Connect to Device` and select `senseBox MCU-S2 ESP32S2` as the device. You may need to allow the editor to access your senseBox MCU-S2.
5. Click on `Select New Folder` and choose the `CIRCUITPY` folder.
6. You may need to allow file editing.
7. Click on `Use CIRCUITPY`.
8. Click on `Open` and open the `code.py` file.
9. The file should already contain some example code. If not, insert the following code:
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
10. Click on `Save + Run`. You should now see `Hello World!` in the console.
