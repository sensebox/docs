# Installing CircuitPython

CircuitPython is a variant of MicroPython developed by Adafruit. It is a simplified version of Python, specifically for microcontrollers. CircuitPython is a great way to quickly and easily get started with programming microcontrollers. In this tutorial, we will show you how to install CircuitPython on your senseBox MCU-S2.

## Installation with the CircuitPython Web-Installer
To install CircuitPython on your senseBox MCU-S2 using the official CircuitPython Web-Installer, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [CircuitPython Download Page](https://circuitpython.org/board/sensebox_mcu_esp32s2/).
2. Connect your senseBox MCU-S2 to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Hold down the Boot button on the senseBox MCU-S2 and then press the Reset button. Release the Boot button.
4. Click on the `OPEN INSTALLER` button and select `Full CircuitPython X.X.X Install` (X.X.X represents the latest CircuitPython version).
5. Click `Next` and connect to your senseBox MCU-S2 in the next menu. Click the `Connect` button and select `ESP32-S2` as the device.
7. Click `Continue` and wait for the flash to be erased and the combined.bin file to be flashed. This process may take a few minutes.
8. Press the Reset button on the senseBox MCU-S2 to start the bootloader. A new drive named `senseBox` will appear.
9. Click `Select Bootloader Drive` and choose the `senseBox` drive.
9. CircuitPython will now be loaded onto the MCU. After a few seconds, you should see a new drive named `CIRCUITPY`.
10. CircuitPython has been successfully installed. The Web-Installer does not indicate when the process is complete, so you can simply close it.
11. You can now use CircuitPython on your senseBox MCU-S2.

## Installation with the senseBox Flash-Tool

Alternatively, you can also use the senseBox Flash-Tool. This method is particularly intuitive and easy to use.

1. Visit the [Flash senseBox Website](https://flashsensebox.netlify.app/).
2. In the `Upload` tab, click `Select Sketch` and choose `CircuitPython`.
3. Connect your senseBox MCU-S2 to your computer using a USB cable.
4. Activate Dev mode by holding down the BootSwitch button on the senseBox MCU-S2 and then pressing the Reset button once. Release the BootSwitch button.
5. Click on the `Search Board` button. A window will open showing connected devices. Your device should have `ESP32-S2` in its name. Select it and click `Connect`.
6. Click `Upload Sketch!` to install CircuitPython. This process may take a few minutes.
7. Press the Reset button on the senseBox MCU-S2.
8. After a few seconds, you should see a new drive named `CIRCUITPY`.
9. CircuitPython has been successfully installed and you can now start programming.
