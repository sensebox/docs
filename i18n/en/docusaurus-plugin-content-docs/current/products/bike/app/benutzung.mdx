# Setting Up the App

Once the senseBox:bike app is successfully connected to your senseBox:bike, you gain access to live data displayed during your bike ride.  
This live data includes a variety of environmental parameters and information about the condition of your bike.  


## Live Data
You have the option to record this data locally and review it later. However, if you want to upload the data to openSenseMap simultaneously, you must first link your user account with the app. This function is located in the menu of the senseBox:bike app.

After successfully linking your account, the data will be automatically uploaded to openSenseMap during recording. This allows you to share your collected data with other users and contribute to environmental research and mapping.

## Private Zones

Furthermore, the senseBox:bike app offers the possibility to set up private zones. In these zones, such as your home, no data will be collected or uploaded to openSenseMap. This ensures your privacy and allows you to customize data collection according to your individual needs. You can find and configure this function in the settings menu of the app.
