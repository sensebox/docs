# Prepare Sensor Mounts

The display, CO<sub>2</sub> sensor, and RGB LED are attached to the sensor mount. Later, it will be connected to the mainboard and tested.

First, attach the four middle spacers on the top side:

Next, you need 6 short spacers and attach them as follows on the same side of the PCB mount:

Finally, attach the frosted plexiglass over the RGB LED on the top side and the display on the other end. Make sure the display is oriented correctly:
