## Connection

To use the senseBox with a solar panel, you only need a Powerboost and a [LiPo battery](https://eckstein-shop.de/LiPo-Akku-Lithium-Ion-Polymer-Batterie-37V-2000mAh-JST-PH-Connector), something around 1000 mAh should suffice.  
The diagram below shows how the components are connected.  
We recommend a [fireproof bag](https://www.amazon.de/Jamara-141360-LiPo-Guard-Lipobrandschutztasche/dp/B003OFCUIS/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=LIPO+TRESOR&qid=1556284975&s=gateway&sr=8-18) for the battery, as damage could pose a serious injury risk.

> Important:  
> The LiPo battery and Powerboost should be protected from moisture when the station is operated outdoors.  
> The appropriate housing is included in the set but is the same as for components like the particulate matter sensor.  
> Note that low temperatures can significantly affect the battery's performance.
