# Setting up the senseBox:home

To ensure successful data transmission and maximize data comparability, here are some tips to consider when setting up the senseBox:home.

## Technical requirements at the installation site

1. Power Supply: The senseBox requires a continuous power supply. The supplied cable has a length of 3 meters.

2. Data Transmission: The senseBox needs a way to continuously transmit data to the internet. The senseBox can be ordered with WiFi, LoRa, or LAN as transmission options. Depending on the version, access to the corresponding network (WiFi network, TheThingsNetwork (LoRa), or LAN cable to the router) is required.

## Installation Site

1.	There is no right or wrong place to set up the senseBox. We encourage you to set up the senseBox where you are most interested in the measurements.

2.	The senseBox community appreciates good documentation on the openSenseMap. This includes:
	*	A picture of the station
	*	Characteristics of the installation site, such as height, shelter, orientation
	*	Other descriptions

3.	From a scientific perspective, there is extensive research on optimal measurement data collection. Many different factors influence the quality of the measurements. We refer to the following points:
	*	Different positions naturally change the measurements. For example, placing the senseBox directly in the sun can result in very high temperature readings due to radiation.
	*	It is also better to place the senseBox a bit away from the house wall (e.g., on a balcony railing) to avoid distortion from heat dissipation. Detailed information on meteorological data collection can be found at the following link: [https://globalcryospherewatch.org/bestpractices/docs/wmo_8-2012_en.pdf](https://globalcryospherewatch.org/bestpractices/docs/wmo_8-2012_en.pdf)

4.	The quality of the measurement data also depends on the placement of the sensors within the senseBox. This information can be found in our construction manuals: [www.sensebox.de/en/material](https://sensebox.de/en/material)

## Maintenance

1.	It is essential to avoid condensation inside the senseBox. Therefore, a visual check of the senseBox is recommended at least once a month. If necessary, the silica gel should be replaced.
2.	The senseBox should be regularly cleaned of any accumulated dirt.
